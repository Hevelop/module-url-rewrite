Hevelop Url Rewrite
=========================

This module has the purpose of making asynchronous the saving of the rewrite url of categories and products.

TODO:
- for each product Hevelop/UrlRewrite/Model/UrlRewriteManager/Product generates the url of each
  category that contains the product. The smart thing would be to only generates the urls of the
  product for the changed category (or categories);
- every time a category is saved, it regenerate urls for every store in which the category is used;
  would be better to;
- add cli command to generate product, category and product-category urls;
- avoid using getAffectedProducts() on categories, fill and use another Object data attribute like getUrlAffectedProducts() instead;
